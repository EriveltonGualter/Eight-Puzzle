# Eight Puzzle 

The [eight puzzle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/15_puzzle) is a slidding puzzle invented a couple hundreads ago. The goal of this project is to implement algorithms of Artificial Inteligence classes that I am learning. The algorithms is not implemented in this version; however, I am working to implement this soon. For while, I build the plataform to the user play using the keyboard.

Commands to play the game:

 * W : move space blank to the top;
 * S : move space blank to the bottom;
 * A : move space blank to the left;
 * D : move space blank to the right;

I am still working in the algorithms; therefore, I do not have much to say.
